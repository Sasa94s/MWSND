This is a collection of three-stage projects required to complete Udacity [Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024).

* [Stage 1 - **Restaurant Reviews**](https://github.com/Sasa94s/mws-restaurant-stage-1)
    - Worked on a static design that lacks **accessibility** and convert the design to be **responsive** on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
    - Added a [Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) to begin the process of creating a **seamless offline experience** for your users.
* [Stage 2 - **Restaurant Reviews**](https://github.com/Sasa94s/mws-restaurant-stage-2)
    - Used asynchronous JavaScript to request data from the backend server instead of parsing a local JSON file. 
    - Stored site content in an offline database using [IndexedDB](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/working-with-indexeddb), which will create an app shell architecture.
    - The site is optimized to meet performance benchmarks, which are tested using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

* [Stage 3 - **Restaurant Reviews**](https://github.com/Sasa94s/mws-restaurant-stage-3)
    - Added a validated form submission that allows user to add a review for a restaurant even if there is lack of connectivity, It takes the user submission and store it until the connection restablishes to send back a POST request to backend server.
    - Added a favorite button that sends PUT request to backend server to update the state of a restaurant, which works offline as well.
    - The site is optimized to meet performance benchmarks, which are tested using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).
